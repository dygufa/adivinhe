## About the code

Adivinhe is a project from 3 years ago that I have the intention of rewrite using a more structured architectural pattern in the next months. It has been deactivated for years and **has a few glitches**. 

## About the game

It's basically a guessing game, one of the members of the room will receive a word that he needs to draw, then the other players on the room must figure out the word. The person with more points in the round is the responsible for the drawing.
